**Question:** During your playtesting were the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules of the game were understandable. The whole point of the game is you're a ball that rolls around and your objective is to collect 10 rings with little gems inside but the catch is that the rings are placed around with a little obstacle course. Once you've collected all rings you must find the exit which is a big red crystal. With the game being dark with little lighting is trying make it feel more eerie in a way, but which might if you were also playing in the dark.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ Not really everything seemed fine, but the only thing I could think of is choosing the color of your ball from the variety of skins they have. I think its fine if there were more levels but the game has about 20 levels all included but spread across 3 different worlds they're held.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ Yeah the game is pretty balanced. There is nothing hard to understand about the game. You could also use a controller if your not in the mood to use your keyboard. Just controlling a ball to collect rings and escape the level.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ Somewhat I would say the movement lag with the controls is a tad bit slow but other than that the game seemed like a neat idea. I would say playing this game in a dark room would change the gameplay a little more from what im getting with the game.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ There wasn't much to the mechanics of the game just a ball rolling around in different levels with different obstacles making the level hard. I seems like a nice combination with the dark eerie environment with a platform game that entices a not a scary but suspenseful way of playing the game.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Yeah it seemed like a good obstacle game with a bit of a dark twist in a way. I like platform games so this was up my alley. I would recommend this to someone that wanted to use up a little bit of there time to try something new.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ Only problem was that it seemed to have only one camera angle so it's hard to navigate through a few levels with the pov of your camera and the level. But other than that the I didn't really have any problems with the game.
