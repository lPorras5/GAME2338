## Summary
   Sea of thieves is an online single or multiplayer game which you play as a pirate and go around the world or sea as I should say and explore different islands, fight other players, look for treasure or make some friends on the sea and create a party. This game is a lot more fun with friends or meeting up with new players and joining there crew.                                                           
   
   You first start of creating your pirate however you like with the limited customization that's given. Once finished if playing with friends you would choose a ship size of how many people can join ship. Small being 1 person, Medium being 2 people and huge ship being 3-4 people. Once the ship is chosen and you've invited your friends or playing solo you start off on an island for a tutorial and how the world works and how the controls work.
  
  The world of sea of thieves is what would you do as being a pirate. You could go battle other people in the server doing ship battles or dropping on an island and fighting with swords or guns. Doing missions which could either be looking for treasure or defeating enemies on islands to earn gold for mostly cosmetic items like different clothing for characters, instrument skins and different antiques for your ship. There are sometimes random occurences of being in a storm and seeing a kraken or sharks around the boat trying to eat you.

## Final Thoughts
I like the ship battles that happen because one minute you could just being looking for a mission with your friends and the next minute you see another ship shooting their cannons at you trying to steal your loot. But to me this game is very grindy and consist of you doing a lot of missions just to get cosmetic items. No story line in the game as well.
