# Game Review for (Super Smash Bros Ultimate)

## Details

### Game Title
Super Smash Bros Ultimate, https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/

### Rating
I give this game a 10/10 rating.
## Summary
  This is a fighting game but different than your usual fighting games. This one consists of a whole bunch of characters from many games mainly coming from nintendo. Examples would be Super Mario Bros, Legend of Zelda, Pokemon and many more video game franchises.
  This game has a variety of characters that have different play styles that you could choose from. Each character has their own pros and cons on what makes them a good character and what makes them have a bad skill set. But apart from that you fight against any character in the roster but its not just a 1v1 you could be doing a 8 player free for all either online or with your friends. It a really fun party game with many friends and its a whole lot of chaos with this many people on one stage.
  The main goal is to throw the enemy of the stage and off the screen either above, below or the side of the screen. Instead of using regular health bars your health consists of a percentage counter. Depending on how much damage you take you your percentage will go higher and each time you get hit there will be some knockback from the hits you take. So the premise of the game the higher your percentage the farther you will be launched when taking damage.
  
## Final Thoughts
I like that the game consists of many lovable characters from different franchises and this game has been somewhat consistent with content especially this new one which they added more characters than the last one and have continued adding more characters to the game. I really dont have one bad thing about this game except the online situation which is has some lag against players that dont have ethernet cable connected to their switch so you will sometimes have lag against some players.
