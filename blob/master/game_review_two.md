### Rating
I'm going to have to say this game is a 10/10 for me personally.

## Summary
  This game is a big part of the Call of Duty franchise that took off and mostly got me into the franchise and play it for the longest
in my childhood. Also the only reason I started to play the franchise was because one my cousin's had the game and I got so interested
in it that when ever I would stay over me and him would always play the game no matter what.
  I was in love with the zombies mode and yes I know that World at war had started the whole mode but Black ops gave it that extra boost
that it needed to be a super good gamemode to me anyways. When I played World at War I was still a kid at the time and it was scary to
me because it was zombies and I was still afraid of a lot of things at the time, but once I got older I got used to these scary things
and zombies was the most fun gamemode I've ever played in my whole childhood. Staying up till 6 am just to try and beat my record of 
how long I survived on the different maps and trying to beat the easter eggs in the game.
  The multiplayer I liked as well just not as much as the zombies. I would play the gamemode most of the time when my friends or family
wanted to play something else besides zombies. And I was fine with it because it had its moments where playing one of the gamemodes like
team deathmatch or search and destroy and you would have to be try hard and not lose and in those moments where you would win are the best.
Just that feeling of clutching or winning a really intense game with your friends or even random people you just met.

## Final Thoughts
I love the zombies gamemode for the fact of its difficulty in the late game and the simplicity of it. Just survive for as long as you can.
With many weapons and upgrades for your weapons and perks that you can get to survive for quite a while. 
Only thing I wasn't to thrilled about was some of the aspects in the multiplayer just using an overpowered gun that players would use
all the time and dying to it over and over again which frustrated me.
