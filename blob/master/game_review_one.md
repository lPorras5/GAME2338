## Summary
  Divinity Original sin 2 is an RPG, Turn-based, Story, Fantasy game that is basically the famous game DND(Dungeons and Dragons)
in video game form. If you don't know what DND is then you must be living under a rock. But we are here to talk about Divinity Sin.
This game is about you, but not actually you a character that you would want to be in the fantasy world.
  When you first load up the game you are hit with a quick introduction video on a story that happened some time ago. I didn't really
pay too much attention to it because I just wanted to go ahead and start playing, now you start a game solo or coop up to 4 players.
First you customize your own character by choosing the type of class you want to be from an abundance of them like Rogue, Mage, Barbarian,
Cleric and the list goes on to a few other ones. After choosing a class you then customize your character with however you choose. Once
you've finished with character customization the story starts you off in a ship with no items on you just the clothes on you and a collar
that allows others to know you're a prisoner.
  Figuring out a way off of the ship you explore the ship looking for a way out. While gathering items, gold, weapons and info from
other prisoners of your wherabouts. As you keep exploring you're looking for ways to level up as well as boosting your attributes to 
expand your class strengths. Although the ship isn't the only part of the level to explore, but it's more of a tutorial for 1st time
players trying out the game. Playing this game does require a lot of play time to know more of the mechanics of the game, but after
a few hours the game gets exciting and scary because you've worked so hard on leveling up your character and not wanting them to die
just to lose all your items. I insist you play this game with friends especially because sometimes adding friends is always a fun time.

## Final Thoughts
The best thing I love about this game is it's basically a DND clone in its own way. I play DND a few times out of the month with some
friends and I love the game, so this game is definitly another way to enjoy the world of DND. Only thing I have a problem with is the
choice of story, although i've only played for the game at least 10 hours I think there is only one main story. Which I wish they
would implement a way to create your own story and having a design your own level to have a more variety and see other peoples ideas
to what kind of stories they can create.
