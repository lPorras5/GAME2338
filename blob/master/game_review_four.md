### Rating
I'm rating this game a 10/10 just because I love board games and this adds more than just board games to the table.

## Summary
  This game could mean a lot of things depending on why you bought this game. Mainly my friend told me about the game and he said it would
be fun if all our friends got it and me looking at the price it wasn't a bad deal and I had bought the game and I don't regret the purchase at all.
  

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
