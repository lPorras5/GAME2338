### Rating
I'm rating this game a 10/10 just because I love board games and this adds more than just board games to the table.

## Summary
  This game could mean a lot of things depending on why you bought this game. Mainly my friend told me about the game and he said it would
be fun if all our friends got it and me looking at the price it wasn't a bad deal and I had bought the game and I don't regret the purchase at all.
  This is a simulator for board games. The game does implement a few board games already downloaded, but people who have bought the game has created the many board games that you buy either at the store or amazon. Many board games can be downloaded from chess, sorry, the game of life, etc. The list can go on forever because you can also create your very own board game. 
  When me and a few friends played this we thought it was dumb at first but when we actually found out that you can download all the board games that have been created we were actually pumped to play some of the games we played either in our childhood or ones we wanted to try out but couldn't afford.

## Final Thoughts
This game just gives you all the board games for a small price about under $20. I can't really find anything wrong about this game it does everything it needs to do as a board game simulator.
