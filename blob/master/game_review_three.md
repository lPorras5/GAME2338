### Rating
I'm going to say this game is a 8/10 for everything its got.

## Summary
  Forza is a big franchise with me starting to play the 4th on in the series. Although I just started my little brother mostly wanted
to play the game because he loves cars, even though I like cars as well just not as much as him. So I saw him playing the game with the
graphics looking awesome and the amount of cars in the game I decided to play it for a little bit and enjoyed it.
  With the amount of cars in the game you would obviously find a favorite on your taste. Me I love the Nissan 370z just because of how
the car looks and how awesome it can turn out with the customization. But there are tiers to the different cars you can use for specific
races and how much you make for winning the races can be changed drastically depending on the tiers. But just the driving in the game looks
phenomenal and while playing it on the PC it makes it look just more outstanding then the console.
  There is customizable tracks but with a bit of a letdown. You could only choose routes in the game of how far you would like the track to
go. It is a little bit of a bummer because you can't really put obstacles or any ramps to spice up the track but sometimes people just love
driving around in the game so trying other peoples tracks will be a little bit of a change of scenery.

## Final Thoughts
The games customization on cars is awesome while also having an app on the phone to customize on teh go. But the track customization could
be a lot more better then just choosing different routes.
