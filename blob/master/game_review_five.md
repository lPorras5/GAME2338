## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.
  Hearthstone is a card game based of the the famous game World of Warcraft. Having the lore from the many characters in the game and having many references towards the game. The basis of the game is you pick a class, create a deck that would tryr to synergize itself and beat your opponent. To be completely honest I've never played World of Warcraft so the many references in the game I wouldn't get, but I still like the game in general.
  The whole premise of the game is to get your opponent to 0 health. Using the 9 different classes in the game from mage, warlock, priest, shaman, hunter, paladin, rogue, warrior and druid. Each class has a variety of cards that would benefit the class and likely the amount of mechanics in the cards that can change the game for that class as well. There is two different cards in the game one being minions and one being spells. A minion is a card that has an attack number and a health number with the cost of mana to play that card depending on the mechanic of the card. A spell can be an abundance of spells buffing minions, giving you health, drawing cards, dealing damage, etc but also having a cost of mana to play the card.
  When you open the game it starts you off with the tutorial on how to play the game. After finishing the tutorial you would want to build a deck from a class that you think would be interesting or fun to play. Possibly trying to synergize your cards so that they play well together to help you in game. After finishing your deck you can start playing against people either casually or in a ranked match trying to climb the ladder. As soon as you get into a game with another player the game flips a coin to sees who goes first and who goes second. After the coin flip the player to go first gets three cards and the second player gets four while also getting a card that helps them out for being second.
  Once the game starts both players start off with 1 mana and can play the cards they can with the amount of mana they have. With each passing turn you get 1 more mana to expand the plays you can make against your opponent, but both players can only get a max of 10 mana so the game doesn't become a unfair match for both players. As players use their decks to beat their opponent the first one to reach 0 health loses. You never know how the game will turn out with how both players play with their decks.
  
## Final Thoughts
I like the different mechanics in the game that can turn a game around for the player. Although the only thing don't like the game about is the microtransactions you can make to get the new cards that come out so you will be ahead of the curve against other players.
